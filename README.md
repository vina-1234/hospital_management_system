Hospital Management System

Overview

The Hospital Management System is a Core Java project designed to manage various hospital operations efficiently. This project utilizes fundamental Java concepts such as Arrays, Strings, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Collections to provide a robust and scalable solution.

Features

Patient Management: Add, update, and delete patient records.

Doctor Management: Manage doctor information and specialization.

Appointment Scheduling: Schedule and track appointments between patients and doctors.

Billing System: Generate and manage billing for patient services.

Data Storage: Use Java Collections for dynamic data storage and manipulation.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java

Core Concepts: Arrays, Strings, OOPS (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction), and Collections Framework

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/vina-1234/hospital-management-system.git

Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).

Compile and run the Main.java file to start the application.

Usage

Launch the application from your IDE.

Follow the on-screen menu to navigate through various features, such as adding patients, scheduling appointments, or viewing doctor details.

Exit the application by selecting the appropriate menu option.

Project Structure

src

Main.java: Entry point for the application.

Patient.java: Defines the patient entity and its attributes.

Doctor.java: Defines the doctor entity and its attributes.

Appointment.java: Handles appointment scheduling and details.

HospitalManagementSystem.java: Contains the core logic for managing hospital operations.

How It Works

The application starts with a menu-driven interface.

Users can select different options to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities such as patients, doctors, and appointments.

Data is stored temporarily in Java Collections (e.g., ArrayList) and manipulated dynamically during runtime.
